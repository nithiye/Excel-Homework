# Excel-Homework

### This repository contains analysis and findings for the following Case Study:
		Over $2 billion has been raised using the massively successful crowdfunding service, Kickstarter, but not every project has found success. Of the more than 300,000 projects launched on Kickstarter, only a third have made it through the funding process with a positive outcome.

    	Getting funded on Kickstarter requires meeting or exceeding the project's initial goal, so many organizations spend months looking through past projects in an attempt to discover some trick for finding success. For this week's homework, you will organize and analyze a database of 4,000 past projects in order to uncover any hidden trends.

#### My Findings:

1)	Given the provided data, what are the conclusions we can draw about Kickstarter campaigns?
    <!--UL-->
    -	Duration of campaign has no direct correlation with declining success rates. However, it prompts the question of how timing and performance rank within each subcategory. 
    -	At a macro level, steady rate of campaign execution has resulted in 53 % success which is a very low confidence level. If we can reduce the 8% cancellations that can add a few more percentage points to success. 
    -	Breaking down the data by year, sub category, time of execution and duration provide a range of insights - Campaign might not be an effective method for all event sub categories.  
    -	Its important to understand what works between Jan and Feb compared to rest of the year to devise improvement strategies. There could also be external factors that make campaigns effective at this point in the year.

		
2)  What are some limitations of this dataset?
    -	Cleanliness of the data: Some of the outliers do not have sufficient background for cause. 
    -	Campaign execution methods (time, people who ran it, channels used) are missing and customer segmentation is unclear. 

		
3) What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
    -	Campaign effectiveness:

        * year over year â€“ for subcategories 

        * success/failure with reference to time of year - subcategory

        * Avg contribution for sub category between successful, failed and canceled

        * Rate of success/failure by sub category and create a comparison chart
